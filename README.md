# ts-node-prettier-vscode-starter

## Want to help?

This project is just getting off the ground and could use some help with cleaning things up and refactoring.

If you want to contribute - we'd love it! Just open an issue to work against so you get full credit for your fork. You can open the issue first so we can discuss and you can work your fork as we go along.

If you see a bug, please be so kind as to show how it's failing, and we'll do our best to get it fixed quickly.

Before sending a PR, please [create an issue](issues/new) to introduce your idea and have a reference for your PR.

We're using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org), so please use it for your commits as well.

Also please add tests and make sure to run `npm run lint-ts` or `yarn lint-ts`.
